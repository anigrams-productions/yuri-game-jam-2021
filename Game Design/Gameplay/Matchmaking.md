# Matchmaking

It's all about the Compatibility %
* Player can customize the calculation by choosing which data to use and assigning weights (importance)

_You_ determine the algorithm: try to find the best match for your client

Possible criteria to determine Compatibility:
* Sexuality
* Number of shared interests
* How well they meet what they both say they're looking for (keyword match)
* Complementary personalities (ex: Zodiac compatibility)
* Special interests and quirks

General process:
1. Interview client
2. Review potential suitors (3 randomly chosen)
3. Choose one suitor to meet with client (first date)
4. Client will say Yay or Nay (random based on probability of compatibility)
    * If Nay, go back to step 2
    * If Yay, client will go on another date with the suitor, after which they say Yay or Nay again
5. After 3-5 successful dates (in randomly determined locations), client will be satisfied and considered "matched"

Gameplay is calendar-based
* Can schedule one event (interview, date, wedding) per day, except on holidays
* Days off should be used for worldbuilding, interacting with known characters, meeting new characters, and, of course, saving the world
* The world is prophesized to end on a particular day, so if you fail to save it before then, it's game over - this deadline adds some stakes and encourages players to spend time wisely

Starting scope:
* 3 clients
* 10 suitors
* 5 locations
* 1 date per client/suitor combination per location
    * Positive version (Yay)
    * Negative version (Nay)
* Happy ending for each client/suitor combination
