# Main Character's Backstory

This is a story about the [aromantic](https://www.webmd.com/sex/what-does-aromantic-mean)/[asexual](https://www.webmd.com/sex/what-is-asexual) experience.

Two girls, childhood friends, grow up together, move in together, but eventually drift apart.

"If I could love, I would love you."

It's clear the other woman feels romantic and sexual attraction for the main character, but the main character can't reciprocate. She wants to, she wishes she could, but it's not enough.

"I'm sorry I can't love you."

"I'm sorry I can't make you happy."

They start to realize that wishes and apologies will never be enough. Frustration and hard feelings build between them, until the other woman finally gives up on their relationship and leaves. The house is eerily quiet and empty without her.

The main character is alone now. Just the way it should be.
